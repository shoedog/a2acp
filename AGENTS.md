# Using a2a-bridge (agent quickstart)

`a2a-bridge` is an A2A↔ACP bridge **and** a multi-agent workflow runner. You can use it as a **tool** to run
clean-room **design**, **code/spec/plan review**, or autonomous **implement** passes against *any* repo —
each step driven by real coding agents (codex, claude, kiro, …) over the Agent Client Protocol.

If you were sent here to "run a workflow / review / design through the bridge," this file is all you need.
Do NOT read `bin/a2a-bridge/src/*.rs` to find the invocation — it's below, and every subcommand has
`--help`.

## 1. Build / install

```bash
cargo build --release --bin a2a-bridge     # → target/release/a2a-bridge
# or: cargo install --path bin/a2a-bridge   # → ~/.cargo/bin/a2a-bridge
a2a-bridge help                            # top-level usage; <subcmd> --help for details
```

## 2. Run a workflow against ANY repo

```bash
a2a-bridge run-workflow <id> \
  --input    brief.md \                # the problem statement / material to act on
  --session-cwd /path/to/target-repo \ # the repo the agents read/work in (NOT the launch cwd)
  --config   examples/a2a-bridge.multi-agent.toml \
  --out      result.md                 # omit to print the terminal node to stdout
```

- The **terminal** workflow node's output is what you get (stdout or `--out`). Runs offline.
- `--session-cwd` is the per-request cwd (ADR-0014). Without it, agents run in the launch cwd, not your
  target repo — a common mistake.

**Built-in workflow `<id>`s** (defined in `examples/a2a-bridge.containerized.toml` and
`examples/a2a-bridge.multi-agent.toml`):
`design` (2 clean-room architect lenses → synth), `code-review`, `spec-review`, `plan-review`.
A workflow is just `[[workflows]]` + `[[workflows.nodes]]` in the config — copy one to make a variant
(e.g. a codex-only `design`).

## 3. Implement a task in a repo (clone → edit → verify → review → commit)

```bash
a2a-bridge implement "Add a --json flag to the export command" \
  --repo   /path/to/target-repo \
  --config examples/a2a-bridge.containerized.toml
```

Clones the repo into a quarantine under `allowed_cwd_root`, runs the **warm** containerized `impl` agent
(edit + fix turns share ONE container + session), build/test-verifies, reviews the diff, and hands off a
branch for you to merge. The default `impl` agent is **codex (gpt-5.5, effort=high)**.

**Land it (`merge`, ADR-0027).** Integrate an **Approved** run's commit into its source repo, re-authored to
**you** (the operator), without touching your working checkout:

```bash
a2a-bridge merge <id> --onto main          # land run <id> onto `main` (fast-forward off its base_commit)
a2a-bridge implement "…" --repo … --merge --onto main   # implement + auto-merge when Approved
```

`merge` re-authors the clone's commit via `git commit-tree` and lands it with
`git push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/<target>:<base_commit>` (the lease IS the concurrency CAS — one of N
concurrent merges wins, the rest get a stale-lease refusal). Operator identity comes from the source repo's
`git config user.name/email` (or a `[merge]` `author_name/author_email` override). **Exit codes:** `0` merged ·
`1` usage/preflight · `2` (`--merge`) run not Approved · `3` (`--merge`) Approved but couldn't land (target
moved / checked out). **Mode A only** (fast-forward `--onto`); a target moved off `base_commit` refuses (re-run
off the moved target). **Caveat:** a source repo with `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead`/`ignore` is out
of scope (the default `refuse` is the no-touch backstop).

## 4. Serve (A2A server)

```bash
a2a-bridge init --agents codex,claude   # scaffold ./a2a-bridge.toml + prompts
a2a-bridge serve --config ./a2a-bridge.toml
```

`serve` advertises each agent's available models/effort/modes on the Agent Card
(`agent-models` extension, probed at startup + refreshed on `SIGHUP`).

## 4b. Discover model/effort/mode values

```bash
a2a-bridge models --config ./a2a-bridge.toml            # table: each agent's advertised models/effort/modes
a2a-bridge models --config … --agent codex --json       # one agent, JSON (card's agent-models shape)
```

Probes live, degrades per-agent. Pass any listed value to the per-request override
(`message.metadata` `a2a-bridge.{model,effort,mode}`) or an agent's config default.

## 5. Inspect / clean up containers

```bash
a2a-bridge containers list  --config examples/a2a-bridge.containerized.toml          # this config's containers
a2a-bridge containers list  --config examples/a2a-bridge.containerized.toml --all    # every managed container
a2a-bridge containers reap  --config examples/a2a-bridge.containerized.toml          # reap DEAD (crashed) only
a2a-bridge containers reap  --config … --all-dead                                    # every owner's DEAD
a2a-bridge containers reap  --config … --force a2a-rw-<owner>-<run>-0                 # reap one by name (any state)
```

`list` classifies each container **alive / dead / unknown** by probing its run's `flock` lease (a free lock
⇒ the owning run crashed) and flags **stale** ones (no output within `--older-than`, default `1h`). Reap is
**Dead-only** by default — a live concurrent run is never touched; `--stale` reaps idle-but-alive,
`--force <name>` is the only override (also how you clear legacy pre-Increment-A containers).

## cwd, configs, creds, concurrency

- **cwd:** `run-workflow` → `--session-cwd`; `implement` → derived from `--repo` (it clones it). `serve` →
  per-request via the A2A message metadata.
- **Configs:** `examples/a2a-bridge.containerized.toml` (containerized agents behind an egress lock + the
  `implement`/verify/review blocks), `examples/a2a-bridge.multi-agent.toml` (host agents + the review/design
  workflows), or `a2a-bridge init`.
- **Creds (containerized agents):** WRITABLE single-file copies in `~/.config/a2a-creds/{claude,codex}` —
  `cp ~/.codex/auth.json ~/.config/a2a-creds/codex/auth.json`, likewise claude (its OAuth token expires
  ~hourly, so re-copy if a claude node starts failing). See `docs/containerized-agents.md`.
- **Concurrency:** concurrent containerized runs are **safe with one shared config** — same repo twice or
  different repos at once. Each run stamps a unique `a2a.run` id into its container names (no clash) and
  holds an OS `flock` lease that marks it alive, so a peer's before-first-use recovery reaps only **crashed**
  (Dead) orphans, never a live run's containers (ADR-0025). Crash leftovers are auto-recovered before the
  next run and inspectable via `a2a-bridge containers list|reap`. (Distinct configs are still fine, just no
  longer required to parallelize.)
