# Orchestration Work — HANDOFF / Resume Doc

> Single entry-point to resume the orchestration roadmap (warm sessions + context mgmt + the A–E roadmap).
> Written 2026-06-17 mid-Slice-1 as compaction insurance. If you're resuming: read this top-to-bottom, then
> `git log --oneline -20` on the current branch to see exactly where execution stopped.

## TL;DR state (2026-06-17)

- **Architecture: CONVERGED.** Whole roadmap architected as ONE design across 3 passes × 2 lenses
  (codex-xhigh + Opus) + a dedicated slicing analysis. Do NOT re-litigate the decomposition.
- **Slice 0 — Live Session Core (warm continue): SHIPPED + MERGED to `main`** (`ded3e3c`, pushed). Live-gated
  on real codex.
- **Slice 1 — Config reconcile + capabilities: SHIPPED + MERGED** to `main` (`469db07`, pushed). Reconcile
  model/effort on warm continue (apply-or-expire); cwd→ConfigMismatch; mode→ConfigReseedRequired; agent caps
  recorded + surfaced in `session/status`. Live-gated on real codex (effort reconcile applied; cwd/mode typed
  errors; caps `{loadSession,resume,close,list,delete=false}`). 8 tasks, each codex-xhigh increment-reviewed;
  the apply-or-expire concurrency (ABA + release-reuse) was caught + fixed via a targeted re-review
  (Reconciling/Expiring non-reusable claim).
- **Slice 2 — Usage telemetry: SHIPPED + MERGED** to `main` (`007b356`, NOT yet pushed). Plumbs the ACP
  `usage_update` (received-but-dropped at TWO gates) end-to-end: map→`Update::Usage`→`TurnEvent::Usage`
  pipeline→translator `EventKind::Usage`→warm-handle `record_usage`→`session/status` (`used/size/windowFraction/
  cost/atMs/overThreshold`)→pre-task `warm_usage_warn_fraction` warn; usage NEVER on the A2A wire (DoD-5).
  8 tasks, each codex-xhigh increment-reviewed. **Live-gated on real codex AND claude:** codex `used/size`
  (windowFraction 0.116), claude `used/size`+**`cost`** ($0.074→$0.087), `used` rose across warm turns,
  `usage_threshold_warn` fired pre-task (turn-2 checkout from carried usage), `overThreshold:true`, zero serve
  errors. **KEY FINDINGS:** the un-drop was a 3-site bridge-acp change (`map_session_update` alone insufficient —
  handler `:973`+`TurnEvent`+`unfold` also dropped non-text); `#[cfg(feature="unstable_session_usage")]` is a
  DEPENDENCY feature NOT a bridge-acp crate feature (a `cfg` compiles it OUT — use unconditional code); the
  pre-existing unary last-chunk truncation re-confirmed live (`PONG`→`ONG`, NOT Slice-2; a real follow-up).
- **Slice 3 — Clear / reset: SHIPPED + MERGED + PUSHED** to `main` (`a5e6f9e`). `SessionClear` =
  `reset_session` (NEW bridge `SessionId` per generation, DIVERGENCE-1; release old + configure new + bump gen;
  process/lease/handle stay warm) + the GENERATION-MONOTONICITY guard (`finish_turn`/`record_usage` no-op
  unless `gen==generation && op==Some(op) && Running`) + `Resetting` claim + `is_claimed` deferral + CLI
  `session clear [--force]`. 3 tasks + a post-merge hardening, each codex-xhigh increment-reviewed; spec
  dual-reviewed + plan dual-reviewed-then-codex-iterated to ready-to-execute over 4 rounds; **live-gated on
  real codex** (codeword forgotten across clear; same warm process; generation 0→1; usage null). **A
  whole-branch codex-xhigh review** (run vs `main`) caught a real cross-task race the per-increment reviews
  missed (FIX-12). **DEFERRED HARDENING (tracked, merge-as-is):** the spec's "## Deferred hardening" section
  records two PRE-EXISTING races `force` surfaces — (1) FIX-12's op-token is PARTIAL (op is task-derived →
  same/omitted `taskId` collides on the cancel→next-turn path); (2) `clear --force` can fire in the
  checkout→`backend.prompt` gap and resurrect the released session. Both need a **"warm-turn cancellation
  tokens" follow-up** (manager-minted unique op + a per-turn abort token through the producer/translator);
  **sequence it before any feature that relies on `force`/cancel under concurrency.**
- **Slice 4 — Compact: SHIPPED + MERGED + PUSHED** to `main` (`98358c1`). `compact` = summarize gen N →
  `reset_session` to N+1 → seed the summary as the next turn's first `Part` (`PrependNextTurn`); require-Idle,
  no force; new `Compacting` claim state. `SessionManager::compact_session(ctx, summarize_fn)` (claim-held,
  EXPIRE on any summarize failure) + `summarize_collect` (direct `backend.prompt` drain, routes around the
  unary truncation) + `pending_seed` take-and-clear at the two resume checkouts + dual-site prepend +
  `SessionCompact` wire + `session compact` CLI + `compact_summarize_timeout_secs` knob. 7 TDD tasks
  (T2/T4/T6 increment-reviewed); spec + plan dual-reviewed (plan codex-iterated to ready-to-execute over 5
  rounds). **Live-gated on real codex** (codeword survived via the seed, throwaway gone, same warm codex-acp
  pid, gen 0→1, usage reset). **The whole-branch codex-xhigh review (iterate-to-clean: r1 2 MAJORs → r2 2
  MAJORs → r3 merge-clean) caught 4 real lifecycle bugs the per-increment reviews missed** (EOF-without-Done →
  partial-seed; caller-future-drop strands `Compacting`; double-compact overwrites the only summary; reap
  TOCTOU defer-expires a claimed handle) — all fixed + regression-tested. See `[[slice-4-compact-shipped]]`.
- **Slice 5 — Serve-backed `run-workflow --serve --context`: SHIPPED + MERGED to `main`** (merge `81d5f27`, NOT
  yet pushed) — **MVP CUT-LINE REACHED; Slices 0–5 COMPLETE.** `plans/specs 2026-06-19-slice-5-serve-cli.md`.
  Plan iterated-to-clear over **13 codex-xhigh rounds** → ready-to-execute; T1–T8 codex-HIGH impl + per-increment
  reviews (T2/T4/T6 caught a test-gap/redundant-cond/test-coverage nit); full workspace gate green; **LIVE-GATE
  PASSED** (real codex: run #1 stored codeword `BANANA42` on ctx C, run #2 on the SAME ctx RECALLED it = warm
  SESSION reused; `session release C` → run #3 replied "unknown" = freed; non-serve run still works). Then the
  **whole-branch codex-xhigh review iterate-to-clean: 10 ROUNDS + a focused ADJUDICATION → APPROVE** caught **~19
  cross-task lifecycle bugs the passing test suite + every per-increment review MISSED**. DOMINANT class: a
  **children-lock DEADLOCK** my own r5 "centralize the prune" fix created — ANY method holding `children` across a
  call whose finalize prunes `children` self-deadlocks → needed **inner-factoring (no-prune inner variant) for ALL
  4 children-holding callers**: `release_with_children`→`release_inner`(r5), `cancel_with_children`→`cancel_inner`
  (r6), `clear_with_children`→`reset_session_inner`(r7), `checkout_child_turn`→`checkout_turn_inner`(r8). Also: the
  **children-leak CLASS** (EVERY `by_context` removal must prune `children` — reap_idle/expire_turn/2× reconcile-
  finalize/compact-expire); the **adjudicated SITE-SPECIFIC warm cancel** (Site #1 before `prompt()` → Normal —
  `AcpBackend::request_cancel` LATCHES even an unseen key, poisoning reuse; Site #2 awaiting `prompt()` → Canceled
  — a container node may have started a turn; in-drain → Canceled); **failed cancel EXPIRES** (new `Cancelling`
  claimed state, cancel-vs-cancel no-op); SYNC `workflow_runs`+`workflow_cancels` registration + `PreProducerRunGuard`
  + `catch_unwind` cleanup + early-`CancelTask` latch; release/clear reject + ATOMIC check+sweep vs active run;
  `--url` requires `--serve`. **KEY LESSON: the whole-branch review (whole `main...HEAD` diff, iterate-to-clean) is
  the only thing that catches cross-task concurrency bugs; a "centralize" fix can have a wide deadlock blast radius
  — the systematic fix is a no-prune inner variant for every lock-holding caller.** **NEXT = Slice 6 (S6 journal)
  per the slicing roadmap.**
  Settled design: `run-workflow --serve --context C <wf>` = a STREAMING serve client (POST
  `SendStreamingMessage` skill=wf + contextId; `--context` requires `--serve`; `--config` serve-side); a
  **dependency-inversion `WorkflowNodeDispatcher`** (cold INLINE in bridge-workflow byte-identical = back-compat;
  warm impl in bridge-a2a-inbound) keyed by derived per-node child contexts `<C>::workflow::<wf>::node::<node>`;
  **`SessionManager` owns child lifecycle atomically** (`checkout_child_turn` registers parent→child + threads
  the exact op/gen so `finish_turn` doesn't no-op; `release/clear/cancel_with_children` sweep); a
  **parent-context workflow-run guard** (concurrent → early `HandleBusy`; `SessionCancel C` cancels the
  scheduler token then sweeps children, drain-on-cancel preserved); one `on_exit(NodeTurnExit)` cleanup
  (finish/`sm.cancel`/expire-on-`AgentCrashed`); gate lift STREAMING-ONLY; `async-trait`→`[dependencies]`; warm
  nodes don't record usage (deferred). Then S6 journal → S7 observability+E9 → S8 MCP → S9 Turn Channel → tail.
- **NEW FOLLOW-UP (from the Slice-4 whole-branch review):** the caller-future-drop + reap-vs-claim TOCTOU
  patterns also exist (smaller window) in the SHIPPED `reset_session`/clear path. Slice 4 fixed compact's
  (wider) version + made `reap_idle` claim-safe for ALL claims; consider the same spawn-detach for
  `session_clear`. Logged in `docs/superpowers/2026-06-18-FOLLOWUP-warm-turn-cancellation-tokens.md`.

## The converged design (don't reopen)

4 seams + a sub-seam: **S1 Session Resource** (serve-side in-memory `SessionManager`, keyed by A2A
`contextId`, holds the registry lease; SHIPPED in Slice 0); **S2 Event/Result Journal** (bridge-owned
`OrchEvent`/`OrchResult`, versioned, tagged; minimal subset shipped in Slice 0; full journal = Slice 6); **S3
Execution Coordinator** (run/continue/clear/compact/fan-out over handles); **S4 Surfaces** (A2A/CLI/MCP
co-equal over one Rust service API; MCP = Slice 8); **Turn Channel** sub-seam (queued-inject +
pending-permission; Slice 9). Settled rulings: clear=new-SessionId-per-generation reset; dual-store (typed
columns for W3b resume vs serialized journal rows); SEQ-AUTHORITY (detached⇒TaskStore, warm⇒SessionManager,
never both); `_meta` for cross-boundary correlation.

## Slice order (from the slicing spec) + status

| Slice | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0 Live Session Core** | warm continue keyed by contextId; SessionManager; minimal OrchEvent/OrchResult; session CLI/methods | ✅ SHIPPED+MERGED |
| **1 Config reconcile + capabilities** | reconcile model/effort on warm continue (else typed reseed); record agent caps | ✅ SHIPPED+MERGED |
| **2 Usage telemetry** | plumb `usage_update` → start/end/`session-status` + pre-task threshold warn | ✅ SHIPPED+MERGED |
| **3 Clear / reset** | `reset_session` (new SessionId per generation) + `clear`; generation guard | ✅ SHIPPED+MERGED (deferred: warm-turn cancellation tokens) |
| **4 Compact** | summarize → reset → seed-as-PrependNextTurn | ✅ SHIPPED+MERGED (whole-branch review caught 4 lifecycle bugs, all fixed) |
| **5 Serve-backed `run-workflow --serve --context`** | CLI as serve client + executor keep-warm policy | ◀ NEXT **— MVP CUT-LINE (S0–S5) —** |
| **6 Event-journal dual-store** | full OrchEvent/OrchResult/OrchCommand Ser+De; the 4-path adapter rewrite; shared `next_seq` | the deferred risky rewrite |
| **7 Rich observability + E9 watchdog** | Plan/ToolCall/config/mode/commands events; watchdog on no-journal-event | |
| **8 MCP surface + D1 typed params** | stdio MCP adapter over a stable Rust service API; CLI thin client | |
| **9 Turn Channel + E2 permission** | queued-inject + PermissionDecision Deny/Modify/Escalate; cancel-resolves-permission | spike-heavy, LAST |
| **10+ tail** | B2 fan-out panel · E1 worktree · E6 retry/resume · E3 batch · E7 task-spec · E8 prompt-lib | defer |

## The proven working loop (per slice)

1. **Spec** (`docs/superpowers/specs/...`) → **dual spec-review** (codex-xhigh + Opus) → fold fixes (v2).
2. **Plan** (`docs/superpowers/plans/...`, bite-sized TDD tasks) → **dual plan-review** (codex-xhigh + Opus)
   → fold fixes (v2/v3). For substantial concurrency/semantics fixes, a **targeted re-review** (codex-xhigh on
   the deltas) is worth it.
3. **Implement per task:** codex gpt-5.5/high is the implementor (USER DIRECTIVE), run host-side via
   `./target/release/a2a-bridge run-workflow slice0-impl --config examples/a2a-bridge.slice0-impl-codex.toml
   --input /tmp/slice1-taskN.md --session-cwd <repo>`. The prompt tells codex to write test+impl together
   (don't gate impl on observing red — the `_dyld_start` flake blocks it), and to leave UNCOMMITTED + report
   BLOCKED(_dyld_start) if the test runner hangs. **The controller (you) then verifies (`cargo test`/build)
   + commits** — codex intermittently can't run freshly-built test binaries (stalls at `_dyld_start`, FN-1).
4. **Per-increment review (USER DIRECTIVE):** after each task's commit, run codex-xhigh on the increment:
   `run-workflow increment-review --config examples/a2a-bridge.slice-1-increment-review-codex.toml --input
   /tmp/tN-review-input.md --session-cwd <repo>` (reads `git show HEAD`). Fold any BLOCKER/MAJOR before
   advancing. **Serialize** (don't run the next task's impl before the prior review reads HEAD).
5. **Gate:** `cargo test --workspace --no-run` (catch `--all-targets` match exhaustiveness — `cargo build`
   MISSES test-target breaks), then `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
   warnings && cargo test --workspace`.
6. **Live-gate:** real serve + codex via `examples/a2a-bridge.slice0-livegate.toml` (codex agent +
   `warm_idle_ttl_secs=5`); `submit --agent codex --context C [--effort ..] --input <f>` + `session
   status|release|cancel C`. Prove the DoD.
7. **Merge:** FF-merge to `main` + push + delete branch (`finishing-a-development-branch`); update memory.

## Resume Slice 1 (the immediately-next work)

Branch `feat/slice-1-config-reconcile`. Run `git log --oneline -15` to see which Tasks committed.
- **T6 (running):** SessionManager reconcile routing — diff-set routing + **apply-or-expire** concurrency
  (claim Running → drop lock → reconcile → re-acquire → identity-revalidate via `handle.id` → advance on
  exact Applied, else EXPIRE the handle) + record `AgentSessionCaps` on the handle + status. Prompt:
  `/tmp/slice1-task6.md`. On completion: verify `cargo test -p bridge-a2a-inbound --lib session_manager` +
  `cargo build -p bridge-a2a-inbound`; commit; then the increment review.
- **T7:** surface `capabilities` in `session/status` JSON (`server.rs ~2842`). Plan Task 7. Small.
- **T8:** workspace gate + live-gate (reconcile applies via `submit --context --effort`; cwd→ConfigMismatch;
  mode→ConfigReseedRequired; caps in status; Slice-0 no-regression) + merge to main.

**Slice-1 key decisions already settled (in plan v3):** reconcile is "apply-or-expire" (discard a
potentially-dirty warm session on any non-exact outcome — no rollback); `AgentSessionCaps` =
`{load_session,resume,close,list,delete=false}` (delete behind a disabled SDK feature); the ACP lift caches
the `session/new` config surface on `AgentSession` + `apply_model_effort(..., ApplyPurpose{Mint,Warm})` (mint
byte-identical via native-error re-raise; warm requires EXACT model+effort apply); SessionManager uses
`fingerprint.diff()` (full set) routing.

## Key gotchas / findings (carried)

- **`_dyld_start` flake:** codex host-implementor intermittently can't run freshly-built test binaries →
  controller verifies + commits. (Motivates E9 watchdog / observability.)
- **`cargo build` ≠ `--all-targets`:** adding an enum variant (`Update::Usage`, `BridgeError::*`) breaks
  `match` in test/integration targets only under `cargo test --workspace --no-run`.
- **Pre-existing bug (NOT Slice work):** unary `result.artifact.text` returns only the LAST streamed chunk for
  multi-chunk replies ("ZEBRA"→"RA"). Reproduces on the legacy path. Follow-up; relates to C1 typed result.
- **Wire methods are PascalCase** (a2a-lf): `SendMessage`, `SessionStatus`/`SessionRelease`/`SessionCancel`.
- **`serve` reads `--config`** (onboarding). The container/host implementor owner key = hash(config,mount,
  agent_id) — concurrent implementors need distinct config files.
- **cargo fmt churn:** codex runs `cargo fmt` which reformats previously-committed files; commit those as a
  separate `style:` commit to keep increments clean.
- Working pattern constraints: sonnet/codex implementor (codex per current directive); codex high-risk+final;
  Opus arch; `max_attempts=3`; dual review at spec AND plan; each increment codex-xhigh reviewed (current
  directive); LIVE-GATE before merge.

## Deferred items / backlog (explicitly NOT in the current slices)

Consolidated from the architecture/slicing/spec "OUT/defer/cut" sections. Track these so nothing is silently
dropped. Most map to later slices; a few are standalone follow-ups.

**Mapped to later slices (sequenced):**
- **Full journal + 4-path adapter rewrite + dual-store + shared seq** — deferred to **Slice 6** (lands WITH
  its consumers; do NOT front-load it — that was the backed-into-order bug).
- **Rich `session/update` variants** (Plan, ToolCall/ToolCallUpdate, config/mode/commands updates) + **E9
  watchdog** — **Slice 7** (watchdog fires on "no JOURNAL event for N s"; needs the journal variants first).
- **MCP server surface (D2) + D1 typed params + CLI-as-thin-client** — **Slice 8** (after the Rust service
  API + ops are stable, to avoid divergence).
- **Turn Channel: queued-inject + pending-permission** + **PermissionDecision Deny/Modify/Escalate** (B1/E2)
  — **Slice 9** (spike-heavy, last). **True mid-turn injection** is deferred even within S9 (ACP is
  request/response; ship queued-next-turn first). **Escalate** bounded with default-DENY.
- **B2 weighted fan-out panel** (pros/cons/cost/benefit/risk) — **Slice 10+** (fix fan-out identity/cancel/
  typed-results first; fan-out already works, so this is UX, not foundation).
- **E1 worktree-per-session · E6 retry/resume · E3 batch · E7 typed task-spec · E8 prompt-template lib** —
  **Slice 10+ tail.**
- **A3 auto-heuristic** (bridge auto-deciding keep-vs-tear-down) + **auto-compaction** — deferred; the slices
  give the orchestrator MANUAL levers (continue/compact/clear/release/TTL/threshold-warn) first.

**Capability-gated ACP actions (recorded in Slice 1, ACTIONS deferred):**
- `session/load` (replay history) + `session/resume` (reconnect) + `session/close` (teardown) +
  `session/delete` (purge history) + `session/list` (enumerate). Slice 1 RECORDS the caps
  (`AgentSessionCaps`); acting on them is later. **`session/delete` is behind the SDK
  `unstable_session_delete` feature — NOT enabled** in `crates/bridge-acp/Cargo.toml` (record `delete=false`;
  enabling it is a deliberate future step).
- **Post-restart `continue` rehydration via `session/load`** — default is typed `SessionExpired` (warm table
  is in-memory/non-durable); the `loadSession`-based rehydration is a documented future upgrade.
- **Slash-command forwarding** (`available_commands_update` → `/name` parts) — deferred (S4-adjacent).
- **fs/terminal client-method surface** (agent→client `fs/*`, `terminal/*`) — the controlled-environment seam
  for E1/E2 containerization; currently the bridge rejects them (`acp_backend.rs ~855`).

**Standalone follow-ups (not a slice):**
- **Warm-turn cancellation tokens** (DEFERRED from Slice 3, merge-as-is 2026-06-18) — two PRE-EXISTING warm-
  session concurrency races (cancel→next-turn op collision; `clear --force` vs producer-start resurrects the
  cleared context). Fix = manager-minted unique op nonce + per-turn abort token through producer/translator.
  **Sequence before any `force`/cancel-under-concurrency feature**; does NOT block Slice 4/5. Durable tracking:
  `docs/superpowers/2026-06-18-FOLLOWUP-warm-turn-cancellation-tokens.md` (also in the slicing spec's
  "Tracked post-merge follow-ups" + the slice-3 spec's "Deferred hardening").
- **Pre-existing unary `result.artifact.text` truncation** (multi-chunk reply → last chunk only;
  "ZEBRA"→"RA"; reproduces on the legacy non-warm path). Real bug, affects all unary sends; relates to the
  **C1 typed-result** work. Fix in the unary `Translator::run(...).collect()` → artifact path in `server.rs`.
- **`usage_update` SDK-version handling / `AgentCrashedKind` enum** — older deferrals (see memory); low priority.
- **`SmallSet` vs `Vec` for `SessionSpecFingerprint::diff`** — used `Vec` (only `.contains`/`.any`); fine.

## Scaffolding (reusable)

- `examples/a2a-bridge.slice0-impl-codex.toml` + `prompts/slice0-impl-node.md` — the codex gpt-5.5/high host
  implementor (generic; `--input <task-prompt>`).
- `examples/a2a-bridge.slice-1-increment-review-codex.toml` + `prompts/slice-1-increment-review.md` — the
  per-increment codex-xhigh reviewer.
- `examples/a2a-bridge.slice0-livegate.toml` — serve config for the live-gate (codex agent, ttl=5).
- Review prompts/configs for spec/plan reviews follow the same pattern (`prompts/slice-*-review.md` +
  `examples/a2a-bridge.slice-*-review-codex.toml`); Opus lenses dispatched via the Agent tool (general-purpose,
  inherits Opus). Many untracked `examples/*.toml`/`prompts/*.md` from prior sessions are NOT this work's —
  don't fold them into commits.
